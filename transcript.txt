welcome to this demonstration of the
readme file generator are you tired of
spending countless hours creating a
readme file for your project this readme
generator is here to help with just a
few simple questions you can generate a
professional looking readme file that
includes all the necessary information
about your project
this tool is especially useful for
developers who wants to Showcase their
projects on their portfolio or GitHub
repo
in this video I'll walk you through the
process of using this generator step by
step so let's get started
now this generator is written in
JavaScript and node.js let's start by
taking a look at the code for the
Javascript file used in a generator
the JavaScript code is divided into two
JavaScript files the first JS file is
called index.js and it prompts the user
with questions to gather information
about the project and the second
Javascript file called generate
markdown.js uses the user input
information to generate the readme file
and the questions are defined in an
array of objects with each object
representing a question type name and
message
the editor type prompts allows you to
input larger text responses that require
more than one line by using this type
you can open a text editor in the
terminal where you can type or paste
your text responses the list type
prompts displays a list of options to
the user and the user can select one
option from the list
now this section of the code checks
whether the user entered a title or not
and if the user enters a title a title
will be displayed in the markdown file
now if the user does not enter a text
this section will not be included in a
generator readme file now to run the
generator open your terminal and
navigate to the directory where the
generator files are located then run the
command node index.js you can also type
node index and it will still work
this will start the generator and prompt
you with a series of questions about
your project such as the project title
description installation instructions
usage instructions and so on and I will
talk more about the content of the
readme in a minute
as you answer each question the
generator will store your responses in
an object once you've answered all the
questions the generator will use that
object to dynamically generate the
readme file
the generated file will include all the
information you provided formatted as a
nicely styled markdown file
let's have a look at an example of the
generated readme file as you can see it
includes the readme's title a table of
contents that links to each section of
the Ruby file a description of the
project as entered by the user
installation instructions usage
instructions contribution guidelines
instructions for testing the project
portfolio and contact information and
the license under which the project is
released
and that's it with this readme generator
you can quickly and easily create
professional looking readme files for
your GitHub projects so thank you for
watching and enjoy
